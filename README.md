## My process

I started off with laying out the website for desktop users first, then I wrote the Javascript code for the calculator to function. After that, I then started making it responsive and making adjustments to the layout as needed.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Gained a lot of knowledge on positioning, as well as some for javascript/react hooks with coding the calcuator.

### Continued development

I feel that I wanna be able to have it scale vertically as well!
